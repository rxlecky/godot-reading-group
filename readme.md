# Godot Reading Group Talk Slides

This repository holds the source to the slides which will be presented in an internal "reading group" talk at [Electric Square](https://www.electricsquare.com/) by [Erik Selecky](http://www.seleckye.com/) and [AJ Weeks](https://twitter.com/liqwidice). The talk will be recorded and posted shortly after being given.


These slides were initially forked from the wonderful [Godot Power Pitch repo](https://github.com/GDquest/godot-power-pitch) - thanks Nathan!
